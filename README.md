CAR PRICE PREDICTION


Objective:-
The objective of this project is to develop a highly accurate model utilizing the Linear Regression algorithm to predict the price of used cars. This model will consider variables such as the brand, model, manufacturing year, fuel type, and mileage of the car.

Problem Statement:-
Determining the price of a new car is relatively straightforward for companies, as it involves assessing manufacturing and marketing costs. However, pricing a used car is more complex due to various factors such as brand, manufacturing year, and more. This project aims to predict the optimal price for pre-owned cars in the Indian market by leveraging historical data using Linear Regression.

Purpose of Project:-
The used car market in India has experienced substantial growth, with its market value nearly doubling in recent years. The emergence of online platforms like CarDheko, Quikr, Carwale, and Cars24 has heightened the need for both buyers and sellers to have access to accurate information regarding market trends and pricing patterns. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict the retail value of used cars based on specific features, thereby offering a solution for car price prediction without human intervention.
